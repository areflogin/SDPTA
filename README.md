This code implements a simple one-neuron perceptron for linearly separable two-class classification in 2D. The user selects training points for two classes using mouse clicks. 
Inputs are augmented with a bias term, and target labels are assigned. The perceptron updates its weights using the delta rule with a sign activation function. During training, the separating line is plotted, 
and the error convergence is displayed in a separate figure. The final weights and the learning progress are visualized at the end.
